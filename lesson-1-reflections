How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

	It diplayed only the lines that were changed, 
	helping pinpoint the origin of the bug.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

	By allowing revisiting of old mistakes
	to assist with new challenges.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

	Pros: each save is more meaningful, and is documented
	Cons: In case of power failure or forgetfulness,
		changes could be lost.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

	They were not made for code, and don't have 
	much use for that feature.	

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

	git log displays the description of previous commits.
	git diff shows the code changes to make it happen.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

	You can revert to a stable build.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

	Android project.
